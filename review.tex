\section{Abstract:}\label{abstract}

Contrast is the currency of the early visual system. Measuring the way
that the computations underlying contrast processing depend on factors
such as spatial and temporal frequency, age, clinical conditions,
eccentricity, chromaticity and the presence of other stimuli has been a
focus of vision science for at least 100 years. One of the most
productive experimental approaches in this field has been the use of the
`steady-state visually-evoked potential' (SSVEP): a technique where
contrast modulating inputs are `frequency tagged' (presented at
well-defined frequencies and phases) and the electrical signals that
they generate in the brain are analyzed in the temporal frequency
domain. SSVEPs have several advantages over conventional measures of
visually-evoked responses: they have relatively unambiguous ouput
measures, a high SNR, and they allow us to analyze interactions between
stimulus components using a convenient mathematical framework. Here we
describe how SSVEPs have been used to study visual contrast over the
past 70 years (Dawson, 1954). Because our thinking about SSVEPs is
well-described by simple mathematical models, we embed code that
illustrates key steps in the modelling and analysis. This paper can
therefore be used both as a review of the use of SSVEP in measuring
human contrast processing, and as an interactive learning aid.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Neurons in the visual areas of the brain are primarily responsive to
changes in cone photoreceptor activations across time and space. This
property, referred to as contrast, sets the fundamental limits of our
visual abilities, which remain steady over a remarkably wide range of
environmental light levels. The human response to contrast can be
studied using many different techniques. Early work used psychophysical
methods to measure contrast sensitivity (Campbell \& Green, 1965),
defined as the inverse of the lowest contrast that can be reliably
detected. But neural responses can also be measured more directly using
techniques such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG. Here we will describe how an EEG
method known as the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP)
technique has contributed to our understanding of human contrast
processing in health, disease and throughout development.

The SSVEP is a continuous electrical response evoked in the brain by
visual stimuli flickering at a constant frequency (Regan, 1966). For
contrast-defined stimuli, such as sine-wave gratings, it is strongest at
the occipital pole, adjacent to the early visual areas that generate the
signal, although careful analysis of individual VEPs reveals multiple
generators throughout visual cortex (Di Russo \emph{et al.}, 2005,
2007). The flickering stimulus entrains neural population responses at
multiples of the stimulus frequency, so continuous EEG data are
typically analysed by taking the Fourier transform, and estimating the
amplitude at these frequencies. Two common variants involve sinusoidal
on-off flicker, where the stimulus alternates between a blank background
and the peak contrast, and sinusoidal counterphase flicker, where the
stimulus alternates in phase (i.e the black regions become white and the
white regions become black). On-off flicker can drive independent
populations of on- and off-cells in the retina once per cycle and can
therefore produce a response at the fundamental flicker frequency, known
as 1F, and its integer harmonics: 2F, 3F, 4F and so on. Counterphase
flicker contains two transients per cycle and therefore does not produce
a response at 1F, only at its even harmonics: 2F, 4F, 6F and so on.
Because square-waves are spectrally broad-band, square wave flicker
tends to produce more complex spectral harmonics than sine-wave flicker.

The higher harmonics of the steady-state signal are generally thought to
reflect nonlinear processing in the visual system (Regan \& Regan,
1988). SSVEP signals can also be elicited by periodic changes of
stimulus properties other than achromatic and chromatic contrast, such
as motion, stereo depth, and facial identity or expression (see Norcia
\emph{et al.}, 2015, for an overview); however our focus here is on the
contrast response.

\section{Why measure responses to
contrast?}\label{why-measure-responses-to-contrast}

Contrast is one of the most fundamental pieces of information that the
eye transmits to the brain. It can be defined as the change in cone
photoreceptor activity over space (`spatial contrast') or time
(`temporal contrast'). Cone photoreceptors - which drive precortical
opponent pathways - contribute to both chromatic and achromatic
contrast, and although most of the research we describe here focuses on
achromatic contrast, SSVEPs have proven to be an excellent measure of
early chromatic processing as well (McKeefry \emph{et al.}, 1996;
Baseler \& Sutter, 1997; Di Russo \emph{et al.}, 2001\emph{a}).

Contrast is relatively simple to define: typically, it is specified as
the percentage deviation of a uniform stimulus from the background. So,
for example, a disk of 100 units of cone activation
(\(I_{\mathrm{stim}}\)) surrounded by a `background' of 50 units of
activation (\(I_{\mathrm{background}}\)) has a contrast of
\(\frac{I_{\mathrm{stim}} - I_{\mathrm{background}}}{I_{\mathrm{background}}}\)
= 100\%. Where patterns are more complex (for example, the sine-wave
gratings or Gabor patches common in vision science), the Michelson
(1927) definition of contrast is specified by the maximum and minimum
excursions from the mean:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-michelson}{\frac {I_{\mathrm{stimmax} }-I_{\mathrm{stimmin} }}{I_{\mathrm{stimmax} }+I_{\mathrm{stimmin} }}.}\end{equation}

These contrast definitions are appropriate both to photometric measures
of stimulus contrast (for example, luminance; Lennie \emph{et al.}
(1993)) and also to definitions based on cone excitations (MacLeod \&
Boynton, 1979; Derrington \emph{et al.}, 1984) which are more common in
work on chromatic processing.

Although its mathematical definition is straightforward, the
computations that underlie contrast processing in the brain have been
the subject of intense research for many decades. The neural code for
contrast, even in the earliest parts of visual cortex, is not simply a
linear transform of the contrast at the retina - instead, contrast
signals undergo a cascade of nonlinear processing stages that, broadly,
attempt to normalise the output relative to the spatiotemporal
environment. This normalization, achieved through a computation called
`contrast gain control' (Heeger, 1992; Foley, 1994; Carandini \& Heeger,
2011) maximises the sensitivity of the visual system by making optimal
use of neuronal bandwidth. As an example, a grating placed at the centre
of a low-contrast background typically appears more intense than the
same grating when superimposed on a high contrast background (see
Figure~\ref{fig-centresurround}).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Figures/centresurround.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-centresurround}The perceived contrast of a stimulus
depends on its context. A high contrast surround reduces the apparent
contrast of the central `probe' region.}

\end{figure}%

A significant body of research into contrast processing is concerned
with how these normalization mechanisms depend on colour (Chen \emph{et
al.}, 2000), orientation (Foley, 1994), eye of origin (Legge, 1979;
Baker \emph{et al.}, 2007), spatial and temporal frequency (Meese \&
Baker, 2009), location (Polat \& Sagi, 1993; Tadin \emph{et al.}, 2003;
Petrov \emph{et al.}, 2005), age (Betts \emph{et al.}, 2005), and the
presence of neurological disorders (Porciatti \emph{et al.}, 2000; Tsai
\emph{et al.}, 2011). The SSVEP has proven to be invaluable in this
research because it provides an objective readout of contrast
representation at different stages of the visual system, and allows us
to `tag' the probe and background at separate frequencies.

Because it provides a direct read-out of neural population activity, the
SSVEP signal can reveal key features of neural signal transduction. For
example, by varying the peak stimulus contrast parametrically, a
`contrast vs response' function can be measured - where the `response'
is typically defined as the amplitude of the SSVEP frequency component
at the stimulus frequency, or a low multiple thereof. This corresponds
closely to similar functions reported by studies measuring single unit
activity or local field potentials in the cortex (Shapley \& Victor,
1980; Morrone \emph{et al.}, 1982). However the SSVEP has the advantage
that it is non-invasive, and so can be measured in awake, behaving human
participants.

To understand the utility of the contrast SSVEP, it is helpful to
identify the cascade of processing stages in the early visual system
that give rise to it. In the following section we illustrate how a
typical SSVEP signal measured over early visual cortex might contain
information about a large number of early visual computations.

\section{Contrast processing - linear and
nonlinear}\label{contrast-processing---linear-and-nonlinear}

Neurons have a limited dynamic range, yet they can transmit information
about visual stimuli that span many orders of magnitude. In the domain
of contrast, to some extent this is accomplished at a population level -
individual neurons typically implement a non-linear, sigmoidal contrast
vs response (CRF) transducer (Tolhurst \emph{et al.}, 1981; Albrecht \&
Hamilton, 1982) and different neurons exhibit peak sensitivity (defined
as the maximum slope of the function) at different contrast levels
(Carandini \& Heeger, 1994; Carandini \emph{et al.}, 1998; Busse
\emph{et al.}, 2009). A neuronal population will therefore span a
sensitivity range greater than any individual member.

Individual neurons at multiple stages of the visual hierarchy also
change their sensitivity depending on the average spatiotemporal
contrast energy of their environment. This ``normalisation'' process is
dynamic and nonlinear and is well-modeled by a hyperbolic ratio function
in which the response of each neuron is modulated by a local `gain pool'
composed of the summed responses of the local neuronal population
(Heeger, 1992; Busse \emph{et al.}, 2009; Carandini \& Heeger, 2011;
Baker \& Wade, 2017).

To better understand these processes, we will show how sinusoidal input
signals might be processed by the visual system to produce SSVEPs.
Figure~\ref{fig-linear} illustrates how sine waves of different
contrasts are processed in a linear system. The first panel shows the
input sine wave, which would be used to modulate stimulus amplitude over
time. Notice that there are five peaks in the waveform during the one
second sample, so the stimulation frequency is 5Hz (F1). The second
panel shows Fourier transform of the waveform, which contains a
substantial peak at this frequency. If we parametrically vary the
stimulus contrast (i.e.~the amplitude of the waveform), the amplitude of
the F1 component increases linearly with contrast (right panel).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Figures/linearsystem.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-linear}Illustration of a sinusoidal input signal
(left), its Fourier spectrum (middle), and how the amplitude of the
first harmonic component increases with contrast (right). These
calculations assume an entirely linear system.}

\end{figure}%

Next we can consider the impact of a nonlinearity in processing on the
responses. One of the simplest nonlinearities is the function that
describes a cell's response to different levels of contrast. In
Figure~\ref{fig-transducer} this is modeled by a hyperbolic ratio
function resulting in a saturating non-linearity:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-nakarushton}{R_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{in}}^n}{C_{50}^n + C_{\mathrm{in}}^n},}\end{equation}

where \({R_{\mathrm{max}}}\) describes the maximum response level,
\(C_{\mathrm{in}}\) is the input contrast (or the time-varying
waveform), \(C_{50}\) is the `semi-saturation constant' (the point at
which the response is at half-maximum) and \emph{n} controls the
steepness of the curve (with a typical value around \(n=2\).

This nonlinearity has clear effects on signal transduction. The
sinusoidal waveform is distorted by the nonlinearity, and appears
frequency doubled (left panel of Figure~\ref{fig-transducer}; note that
other nonlinearities such as rectification and squaring can have similar
effects). The distortion is reflected in the Fourier spectrum (middle
panel of Figure~\ref{fig-transducer}), which now includes responses at
integer multiples (known as harmonics) of the stimulation frequency (10,
20 and 30Hz), but no response at the fundamental (5Hz). Finally, the
contrast response function is now nonlinear (right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig-transducer}). Although the hyperbolic ratio function
(Equation~\ref{eq-nakarushton}) is monotonic, the CRF resulting from
measuring the amplitude of the second harmonic (2F) component contains a
slight roll-off at high input contrasts. This results from the
distortion of the input sine waves at high contrast due to a combination
of the full-wave rectification and saturating non-linearity. Power at
other harmonics increases, and the total power generated by the input is
monotonic. This roll-off is often seen in experimental data and has been
referred to as `supersaturation' (Tyler \& Apkarian, 1985; Peirce,
2007).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Figures/transducer.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-transducer}Illustration of how a sinusoidal input
signal is affected by a nonlinear transducer. The input wavefore (left
panel) is frequency doubled by the squaring operator, and now features
energy at the second harmonic (10Hz) and its multiple (middle panel).
The contrast response function at the second harmonic is now nonlinear,
and saturates at high contrasts (right panel).}

\end{figure}%

To illustrate the effect of contrast gain control (Heeger, 1992), we
next include a second component (a `mask') that contributes to the gain
pool of the first (the `target'). The mask stimulus will suppress the
response at the target frequency, reducing its amplitude. The
suppression is reciprocal - activity at the mask frequency is also
reduced by the presence of the target, in a contrast-dependent manner
(Busse \emph{et al.}, 2009). At a single pair of (matched) contrast
levels, we see a complex pattern of intermodulation terms in the
transduced waveforms (left panel of Figure~\ref{fig-twoinputs}) and in
the Fourier spectrum (middle panel of Figure~\ref{fig-twoinputs}). The
two components interact generating nonlinear intermodulation terms at
sums and differences of the input frequencies (F1, F2). The nature of
the interaction --- and therefore the pattern of intermodulation terms
--- is determined by the computations happening as the contrast signal
moves from retina to cortex (Regan \& Regan, 1988).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Figures/twoinputs.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-twoinputs}Demonstration of how two inputs of
different frequencies are processed by a nonlinear transducer.
Additional harmonics are apparent in the Fourier spectrum (middle
panel), and the contrast response function is suppressed (right panel).}

\end{figure}%

If the two inputs were simply added together, the representation of the
resulting signal in the Fourier domain would be the linear sum of the
two independent signals (i.e.~peaks at F1 and F2). However, it is
important to take physiology into account. Contrast gain control reduces
the amplitude of the responses via a suppressive process, which can be
incorporated into our transducer function via an additional denominator
term:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-gaincontrol}{R_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{in}}^n}{C_{50}^n + C_{\mathrm{in}}^n + C_{\mathrm{mask}}^n},}\end{equation}

where \(C_\mathrm{mask}\) reflects the contrast of the mask component at
a distinct frequency from that of the target. The effect of this extra
term is to reduce the target response (see right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig-twoinputs}). For a linear contrast axis, the contrast
response function becomes shallower, whereas on a logarithmic contrast
axis it maintains its steepness and shifts to the right. Suppressive
effects of this kind have been obtained using SSVEP with a variety of
different types of mask, including orthogonal overlaid masks, surround
masks, and dichoptic masks (Burr \& Morrone, 1987; Ross \& Speed, 1991;
Candy \emph{et al.}, 2001; Busse \emph{et al.}, 2009; Cunningham
\emph{et al.}, 2017; Salelkar \& Ray, 2020; for a meta-analysis see
Baker \emph{et al.}, 2021).

Even without considering a spatial component, the early visual system is
far more complex than the model here suggests. For example as well as
cells that code positive or negative contrast in a more or less
continuous manner, the retina also contains `transient' cells that code
temporal changes in contrast. These cells (Kuffler \emph{et al.}, 1957;
Alpern, 1971), and cells with similar properties in the LGN (Levitt
\emph{et al.}, 2001) and cortex (Hubel \& Wiesel, 1959; Movshon, 1975),
will introduce second harmonic components even when the stimulus itself
is modulated in an on-off fashion. Analogously, in the spatial domain,
so-called `simple cells' are sensitive to the polarity of a spatial
contrast modulation while `complex cells' respond to the presence of
patterned spatial contrast irrespective of its spatial position (Hubel
\& Wiesel, 1962). The SSVEP response to a contrast-reversing sine-wave
grating therefore contains information about nonlinear computations
performed across a range of retinal and cortical cell types.

The complexity of even a simple simulation of the frequency-domain
signal arising from non-linear interactions is intriguing. Presumably,
the signal measured from early visual cortex is the result of a cascade
of nonlinear retinal and cortical operations up to that point. It
therefore contains a `signature' of the computational nature, order and
parameters of those operations - including the shape of the transducer
functions and the computations involved in signal combination. In
principle, that information could be recovered from the SSVEP signal - a
possibility recognised in the early days of the technique (Regan \&
Regan, 1988). Although characterising the complete set of computations
along entire processing pathway is challenging, careful parametric
variation of the input stimuli does allow us to fit models of early
visual gain control using SSVEP data. For example, Tsai \emph{et al.}
(2012) demonstrated that a gain control model gave a good account of the
pattern of intermodulation responses produced by two overlaid patterns
flickering at different frequencies. This was achieved by passing full
stimulus waveforms through the transducer nonlinearity, and calculating
the Fourier spectrum of the model output. Our own work on signal
combination across eyes and space similarly demonstrated close
correspondence between the predictions of a computational model and
empirical data in humans (Baker \& Wade, 2017). More detailed modelling
of intracortical recordings (Groen \emph{et al.}, 2022) has revealed
details of the timecourse of gain control effects, specifically that
normalization is delayed slightly relative to the initial visual
response.

Similar changes to the contrast response function might also be obtained
using adaptation paradigms, in which the visual system is exposed to
high contrast stimuli for long durations. Psychophysically, adaptation
increases detection thresholds, but has little effect on contrast
discrimination performance (Ross \emph{et al.}, 1993), much like pattern
masks (Foley, 1994). Although SSVEP adaptation effects show strong
tuning for orientation (Campbell \& Maffei, 1970; Vergeer \emph{et al.},
2018) and spatial frequency (Mecacci \& Spinelli, 1976), there appear to
be no studies measuring the full SSVEP contrast response function before
and after an extended period of adaptation.

\section{Measuring the development of contrast
processing}\label{measuring-the-development-of-contrast-processing}

An early use of the SSVEP was to provide an objective estimate of
spatial contrast sensitivity in infants, without requiring behavioural
responses. In well-motivated adults, psychophysical measurements of
contrast sensitivity remain the gold standard. However, it is difficult
and time consuming to obtain reliable psychophysical data from infants.
In these cases, SSVEP measurements represent a fast and efficient method
for measuring low-level visual responses (Tyler \emph{et al.}, 1979;
Braddick \emph{et al.}, 1986; Norcia \emph{et al.}, 1990) and the high
SNR of SSVEP means that infants need only look at the screen for short
periods of time.

Because SSVEP responses at detection threshold are very small,
estimating a threshold is achieved by measuring the contrast response
function at relatively high levels, and extrapolating back along the
function (either contrast vs response measured at a constant spatial
frequency or spatial frequency vs response at a constant contrast level)
to estimate its intercept with the x-axis (see
Figure~\ref{fig-sweepvep}). This contrast level was shown to correspond
approximately with psychophysically measured detection thresholds
(Norcia \emph{et al.}, 1986).

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Figures/sweepplot.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-sweepvep}Sweep VEP simulation showing how a contrast
detection threshold can be estimated from sweep VEP data measured at
higher contrasts. The solid line is the regression fit to the lowest
four data points, and the dashed line extrapolates the fit back to
determine the contrast value when y=0, which gives a threshold estimate
(red point).}

\end{figure}%

A robust estimate of the threshold therefore requires the measurement of
the SSVEP amplitude at many different super-threshold contrasr levels.
This was made faster by the development of the `sweep VEP' paradigm in
which the stimulus changed its contrast, spatial frequency or some other
property, throughout a trial (Tyler \emph{et al.}, 1979). To avoid
hysteresis effects, the sweep is sometimes conducted both up and down in
the same experiment Norcia \& Tyler (1985\emph{a}). The sweep VEP
(really, a sweep `SSVEP') technique is now commonly-used to obtain a
rapid and objective measurement of visual acuity. In particular, because
of its relative speed and simplicity, this technique has now become a
standard for conducting tests of visual acuity in very young subjects or
where behavioural tests are not appropriate (Ridder, 2004; Bach \emph{et
al.}, 2008; Hoffmann \emph{et al.}, 2017; Bach \& Farmer, 2020).

This approach has revealed much about the development of visual
abilities in infants (Harris \emph{et al.}, 1976; Atkinson \emph{et
al.}, 1979; Braddick \emph{et al.}, 1986). In general, SSVEP
measurements of infant vision have revealed that contrast sensitivity
for both achromatic and chromatic contrast as well as stereoscopic depth
perception develops earlier than had been supposed previously based on
behavioural readouts (Dobson \emph{et al.}, 1978; Norcia \& Tyler,
1985\emph{b}) with both chromatic and achromatic contrast detection
reaching near-adult levels by around six months. Spatial acuity as
measured by SSVEP reaches adult levels more slowly, but near-adult
levels are recorded around one year (Norcia \& Tyler, 1985\emph{b};
Hamer \emph{et al.}, 1989) compared to around six to seven years with
behavioural measures (Atkinson \& Braddick, 1983; Ellemberg \emph{et
al.}, 1999). At least some of this difference is likely due to the
relative objectivity and high SNR of the SSVEP technique compared to
other methods such as preferential looking, which require careful
measurement of the infant's gaze direction. However it should be noted
that other groups have reported electrophysiological correlates of
visual acuity that more closely match the behavioural measures (De
Vries-Khoe \& Spekreijse, 1982).

The SSVEP technique has also been used to study the development of the
contrast gain control mechanisms described in the previous section
(Candy \emph{et al.}, 2001; Pei \emph{et al.}, 2017). Although contrast
gain control is measurable in infants as young as six weeks old (Morrone
\& Burr, 1986; Skoczenski \& Norcia, 1998; Candy \emph{et al.}, 2001),
its development appears to be slower, with adult levels being reached at
approximately 11 years (Pei \emph{et al.}, 2017).

\section{Contrast processing in clinical
conditions}\label{contrast-processing-in-clinical-conditions}

The SSVEP technique has also been used to study clinical conditions,
such as diseases and developmental disorders. This can often be
informative regarding the underlying mechanism that characterises the
condition. Here we focus on four conditions, but there is potential to
apply the method more broadly, either as a diagnostic technique, or to
monitor disease severity and progression, or the efficacy of treatments.

Epilepsy is a neurological condition in which patients experience
seizures - episodes of uncontrolled neural activity that can cause
unconsciousness, involuntary movements and convulsions, and atypical
sensory experiences. Porciatti \emph{et al.} (2000) showed that
individuals with photosensitive epilepsy generate larger steady-state
signals in response to flickering visual stimuli, and their contrast
response functions saturate less than those of healthy controls. This is
consistent with the idea that epilepsy involves a cortical
hyperexciteability that makes seizures more likely. It is also the case
for individuals with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (Tsai \emph{et
al.}, 2011), a subtype of epilepsy that has a less obvious link to
vision. The differences apply across the whole contrast-response
function, and so resemble a response gain effect (see
Figure~\ref{fig-plotclinical}a), which might be due to reduced
inhibition from neighbouring neurons. Differences in SSVEP amplitudes
have also been reported in individuals with migraine (Shibata \emph{et
al.}, 2008), a condition also associated with cortical
hyperexciteability.

Amblyopia is a disorder of binocular vision, characterised by one eye
contributing much less to perception than the other. This is often due
to strabismus (squint) or anisometropia (difference in optical
prescription between the eyes) during development. Contemporary accounts
suggest that the amblyopic eye is suppressed by signals from the fellow
eye. SSVEPs provide a convenient and objective method to characterise
the difference in neural response to signals in each eye, and typically
show reduced responses to stimuli in the amblyopic eye (see
Figure~\ref{fig-plotclinical}b) across the contrast range (Baker
\emph{et al.}, 2015; Lygo \emph{et al.}, 2021). There are currently many
novel binocular treatments for amblyopia under development, often
involving virtual reality or stereo display systems designed to
encourage the two eyes to work together. The steady-state approach may
be more sensitive and objective than typical acuity measurements, and
also has the potential to measure suppression between the eyes directly
(e.g. Zheng \emph{et al.}, 2019; Hu \emph{et al.}, 2023; Du \emph{et
al.}, 2023).

Autism is a condition often associated with differences in vision
(Simmons \emph{et al.}, 2009) and other senses (MacLennan \emph{et al.},
2022). Pei \emph{et al.} (2014) used a sweep-VEP method with
counterphase flickering stimuli, and found weaker responses in autistic
children at spatial frequencies around 8c/deg, compared with age-matched
controls. This was subsequently replicated in a further pediatric sample
by Vilidaite \emph{et al.} (2018) (see Figure~\ref{fig-plotclinical}c),
who additionally found weaker responses in autistic adults at the second
harmonic (using on/off flicker). Interestingly this study replicated its
key findings in a \emph{Drosophila} genetic model of autism (\emph{Nhe3}
mutations), illustrating the translational potential of the steady-state
approach, as well as identifying a possible biomarker for autism.

Recent work on understanding Parkinson's disease has also used
\emph{Drosophila} genetic models. Afsari \emph{et al.} (2014) found that
mutant flies produced stronger SSVEP responses to flickering lights than
control flies (see Figure~\ref{fig-plotclinical}d). The authors
theorised that differences in early gain control during development
might lead to visual deficits later in life. Although visual responses
are a convenient assay of neural function, it is likely that same
general process applies throughout the whole brain, including in the
motor system where the core Parkinson's symptoms (tremor, rigidity, slow
movement) manifest. The SSVEP differences were reduced by a kinase
inhibitor that targets the dopamine system, demonstrating how model
organisms can be used to test new pharmacological treatments. SSVEP
responses also provide a potential method to diagnose Parkinson's before
any symptoms manifest, and to monitor the effect of treatments.

\section{Attention}\label{attention}

Attention exerts a profound influence on visual performance: for
example, allowing people to attend covertly to a spatial location
improves their performance on a target detection task significantly
(Bashinski \& Bacharach, 1980; Posner, 1980; Carrasco \emph{et al.},
2000; Cameron \emph{et al.}, 2002; Morrone \emph{et al.}, 2004; Pestilli
\emph{et al.}, 2009). In principle, this enhancement may be driven both
by modulation of the underlying signal or noise characteristics, or by
additional decision-theoretic factors such as reduction in spatial
uncertainty (Petrov \emph{et al.}, 2006; Gould \emph{et al.}, 2007).
Early experiments with non-human primates showed little evidence for
attentionally-driven changes in neuronal spike rates (Luck \emph{et
al.}, 1997; McAdams \& Maunsell, 1999; Mehta \emph{et al.},
2000\emph{a}, 2000\emph{b}; Marcus \& Van Essen, 2002), but with the
advent of spatially-resolved human brain imaging methods in the late
1990s it became apparent that spatial attention was linked to frank
changes in both fMRI BOLD responses (Tootell \emph{et al.}, 1998; Somers
\emph{et al.}, 1999; Gandhi \emph{et al.}, 1999; Brefczynski \& DeYoe,
1999; Kastner \emph{et al.}, 1999; Buracas \& Boynton, 2007; Silver
\emph{et al.}, 2007; Li \emph{et al.}, 2008; Murray, 2008) and EEG
signals (\textbf{MullerHillyard2000?}).

Electrophysiological and psychophysical measurements of the effect of
attention on both luminance and chromatic contrast have strongly
implicated gain control as an underlying mechanism (Lu \& Dosher, 1998;
Di Russo \& Spinelli, 1999\emph{a}; Di Russo \emph{et al.},
2001\emph{b}). These effects also appear to differ between chromatic and
achromatic pathways (Di Russo \& Spinelli, 1999\emph{b}) - perhaps as a
result of the different levels of nonlinear gain control in the early
pre-cortical magno-, parvo- and konio-cellular pathways (Derrington \&
Lennie, 1984; Kaplan \& Shapley, 1986; Lee \emph{et al.}, 1990; Solomon
\& Lennie, 2005). In the late 2000s a comprehensive theoretical model
for attentional modulation was developed that framed it as a gain
control computation (Reynolds \& Heeger, 2009; Boynton, 2009). This
framework has proven to be influential - explaining a wide range of
phenomena from the earlier literature and demonstrating subtle
interactions between the size of the attentional `spotlight' and the
stimulus configuration which rationalise many apparent contradictions in
the literature. Direct measurements of attentional modulation of
achromatic SSVEP signals are broadly consistent with this model
Martinovic \& Andersen (2018) and confirm the relatively weaker role of
spatial attention on responses driven by chromatic stimuli -
particularly those that isolate the opponent S-(L+M) cone pathway
Highsmith \& Crognale (2010). The gain control model of attention can
also be extended to SSVEP studies of feature-based attention which show
that the modulatory effects can be targeted to the most informative
neuronal populations (Verghese \emph{et al.}, 2012).

\section{Brain-computer interfaces}\label{brain-computer-interfaces}

One widespread recent application of the SSVEP technique is in the
design of brain-computer interfaces, which seek to control some aspect
of a computer using neural signals. The high SNR and frequency
resolution of SSVEPs make them an ideal candidate for this approach.
Typical studies may involve presenting an array of stimuli at different
contrast flicker frequencies, and having the participant select one
either by overt attention (i.e.~shifting fixation to foveate the
selected stimulus) or covert attention (i.e.~deploying attention to one
stimulus whilst keeping fixated) (\textbf{Middendorf?}). BEcause EEG
signals are highly sensitive to both visual field position (Ales
\emph{et al.}, 2010) and attentional state (Lauritzen \emph{et al.},
2010; Verghese \emph{et al.}, 2012), the response to the selected
stimulus will typically increase relative to the others, allowing it to
be identified by an on-line algorithm. Because more than one stimulus
frequency is typically present, this modulation and the associated
changes in gain control, will affect the entire pattern of self- and
intermodulation terms.

This approach is primarily useful in situations that require the BCI to
distinguish from among a small set of possibilties : For example, in
early work, visual stimuli representing `Left' and `Right' commands in a
flight simulator were distinguished robustly (\textbf{Middendorf?}).
Although SSVEP-based BCI interfaces typically do use contrast flicker,
work in this field has largely focused on optimising the stimuli or
decoders to increase decoding performance (e.g.~\ldots{} ) and reducing
visual fatigue associated with the long-term presentation of arrays of
high-contrast flicker (e.g.~\ldots..) rather than studying visual
contrast processing \textit{per se}.

{[}Around here perhaps a section about what gain control is, mentioning
other methods as well including psychophysics, MRI, electrophysiology,
and other EEG markers including ERPs and evoked gamma band oscillations.
Maybe outline the Heeger gain control model and its cousins.{]}

{[}Sure. But in fact gain control is only a small part of this story -
especially in the early days. They were, I think, more interested in
using SSVEP to measure absolute contrast sensitivity and to get lower
bounds on things like infant visual development. Gain control might be
better as a separate section later.{]}

\phantomsection\label{anchor-4}{}2. Spatial, temporal frequency and
contrast sensitivity measurements

Basically using SSVEP to measure a cortical output amplitude for any
given input contrast. You can vary parameters like SF, TF, position,
color and of course contrast. Early on people realised that you can
`sweep' the stimulus to get a CRF. You broadly get a line in log
contrast space if you do that (Tyler) - then you can extrapolate that
line down to zero response to estimate the threshold. That doesn't
\textgreater quite\textless{} work but it's pretty close.

You can also use this for `difficult' populations like babies. One
interesting story was about how SSVEP become a replacement for
preferential looking (which was the other way of looking at infant
visual development). See e.g.~Davida Teller. SSVEPs allowed people to
make objective measurements of contrast sensitivity development and
deduce that the visual system was more mature (e.g.~more functional) in
infancy than previously expected. Also measures of colour sensitivity.
Tinyeyes is based off those measurements. Other people: Tyler, Norcia,
Gunilla H-P, many of the people at SKERI in the 1980s and 90s. Norcia
86,88,90 - mentioned in Regan's nice autobiography :

In parallel of course, people were using frequency tagging to do single
unit work - the 1F vs 2F simple/complex cell classification scheme was
all about this (Lennie and others).

\phantomsection\label{anchor-5}{}3. SSVEP in functional localization

Techniques like fMRI have been combined with SSVEP to achieve more
precise spatial localization (Di Russo et al., 2007). See however the
Ales cruciform paper.

Ales and Norcia:... (showed that people's intuition about V1 upper /
lower v.f reversing polarity wasn't really correct). This feels a little
outside our scope though... We have also combined SSVEP with source
imaging techniques to probe responses in different cortical locations
(again, Ales papers, some early stuff from Stan K? Appelbaum, Wade,
Norcia figure/ground...) and then a host of later work from that lab and
others.

\phantomsection\label{anchor-6}{}4. SSVEP and contrast gain control
including adaptation, masking, and attention

{[}The story goes: Up to the lte 90s people were primarily interested in
measuring contrast sensitivity - the shape of the response function was
assumed to be basically log-linear - and they fit it with straight lines
to extrapolate back to zero response. But then (once Heeger's 1992 paper
had sunk in - see also stuff like Shapley and Victor 1981
\href{https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zAmtgj}{(Shapley \& Victor,
1981)}), people started thinking about gain control - Candy and Norcia
in about 1999, Porciatti, probably a load of Tyler papers that I don't
even know about...{]}. Probably look in p

And then people worked out that if you can use SSVEP to measure contrast
responses, you can also use it to measure things that modulate contrast
responses. These include adaptation, masking, suppression, attention
(feature and space), clinical things.

\phantomsection\label{anchor-7}{}Adaptation:

Continuous exposure to high-contrast patterns reduces contrast
sensitivity, which can be measured using SSVEP (Ross et al., 1989).
Others? Baker recent gain control paper is perhaps worth mentioning here
as a `confound' of sorts. Engel 2018
\href{https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?kdURiS}{\emph{(Vergeer et al.,

\href{https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?J2EO3d}{\emph{(Rideaux et al.,
2023)}} and \textgreater sort\textless{} of SSVEP.

\phantomsection\label{anchor-8}{}Masking:

High contrast masks can suppress the visibility of low contrast
patterns, which has implications in SSVEP amplitude (Haynes et al.,
2003).

Attention: Directing attention can enhance contrast sensitivity, as
shown in studies using SSVEP (Müller et al., 2006). Also Tsai
