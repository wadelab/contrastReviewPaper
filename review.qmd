## Baker, Wade: Review: Vis Neurosci

Neurons in the visual areas of the brain are primarily responsive to differences between light and dark in an image. This property, referred to as contrast, sets the fundamental limits of our visual abilities, which remain steady over a remarkably wide range of environmental light levels. The human response to contrast can be studied using many different techniques. Early work used psychophysical methods to measure contrast sensitivity (Campbell & Green, 1965), defined as the inverse of the lowest contrast that can be reliably detected. But neural responses can also be measured more directly using techniques such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG. Here we will describe how an EEG method known as the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) technique has contributed to our understanding of human contrast processing in health, disease and throughout development.

The SSVEP is a continuous electrical response evoked in the brain by visual stimuli flickering at a constant frequency (Regan, 1966). For contrast-defined stimuli, such as sine-wave gratings, it is strongest at the occipital pole, adjacent to the early visual areas that generate the signal. The flickering stimulus entrains neural responses at multiples of the stimulus frequency, so continuous EEG data are typically analysed by taking the Fourier transform, and estimating the amplitude at these frequencies. Two common variants involve sinusoidal on-off flicker, where the stimulus alternates between a blank background and the peak contrast, and sinusoidal counterphase flicker, where the stimulus alternates in phase (i.e the black regions become white and the white regions become black). On-off flicker produces a response at the fundamental flicker frequency, known as 1F, and its integer harmonics: 2F, 3F, 4F and so on. Counterphase flicker does not produce a response at 1F, only at its even harmonics: 2F, 4F, 6F and so on. Variants involving square wave flicker can additionally produce more complex spectral components. The higher harmonics of the steady-state signal are generally thought to reflect nonlinear processing in the visual system (Regan & Regan, 1988). SSVEP signals can also be elicited by periodic changes of stimulus properties other than contrast, such as chromaticity, motion, stereo depth, and facial identity or expression (see Norcia et al., 2015, for an overview); however our focus here is on the contrast response.

```{python}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scipy as scp

inputFrequencies_Hz=np.array([5,7])

duration_S=1

digitisationRate_Hz=1000

support_S=np.linspace(0,duration_S,duration_S*digitisationRate_Hz)

inputModulations = np.zeros((len(support_S), len(inputFrequencies_Hz)))

for i, freq in enumerate(inputFrequencies_Hz):
    inputModulations[:, i] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * support_S)

# Create a figure with two subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(inputFrequencies_Hz), 1, figsize=(8, 6))

# Plot each input modulation in a separate subplot
for i, freq in enumerate(inputFrequencies_Hz):
    axs[i].plot(support_S, inputModulations[:, i])
    axs[i].set_xlabel('Time (s)')
    axs[i].set_ylabel('Amplitude')
    axs[i].set_title('Frequency: {} Hz'.format(freq))

# Adjust the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()

```

The two inputs are represented here as amplitude modulations across time. 

If the two inputs are simply added together, the representation of the resulting signal in the Fourier domain is just the linear sum of the two independent signals:

```{python}

freqCutoff_Hz=30
combinedSignal=np.sum(inputModulations,axis=1)
FT_combinedSignal=np.fft.fft(combinedSignal)/len(combinedSignal)
fig,axs=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,6))
axs[0].plot(support_S,combinedSignal)
axs[0].set_xlabel('Time (s)')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Amplitude (a.u.)')
axs[0].set_title('Input signals with linear combination')

# Create the frequency support for the FFT plot
frequencySupport = np.arange(1,freqCutoff_Hz*duration_S+1) # We only want to plot the frequencies in the FFT up to this point

# Plot the absolute values of the FFT in the second axis as a bar plot
axs[1].bar(frequencySupport, np.abs(FT_combinedSignal[frequencySupport]))
axs[1].set_xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Magnitude (a.u.)')
axs[1].set_title('FFT of Combined Signal')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

response evoked in the brain by visual stimuli flickering at a constant
frequency (Regan, 1966).

Contrast Sensitivity: The ability to detect differences in luminance
between an object and its background (Campbell & Green, 1965).

\[Around here perhaps a section about what gain control is, mentioning
other methods as well including psychophysics, MRI, electrophysiology,
and other EEG markers including ERPs and evoked gamma band oscillations.
Maybe outline the Heeger gain control model and its cousins.\]

\[Sure. But in fact gain control is only a small part of this story -
especially in the early days. They were, I think, more interested in
using SSVEP to measure absolute contrast sensitivity and to get lower
bounds on things like infant visual development. Gain control might be
better as a separate section later.\]

[]{#anchor-4}2. Spatial, temporal frequency and contrast sensitivity
measurements

Basically using SSVEP to measure a cortical output amplitude for any
given input contrast. You can vary parameters like SF, TF, position,
color and of course contrast. Early on people realised that you can
'sweep' the stimulus to get a CRF. You broadly get a line in log
contrast space if you do that (Tyler) - then you can extrapolate that
line down to zero response to estimate the threshold. That doesn't
\>quite\< work but it's pretty close.

You can also use this for 'difficult' populations like babies. One
interesting story was about how SSVEP become a replacement for
preferential looking (which was the other way of looking at infant
visual development). See e.g. Davida Teller. SSVEPs allowed people to
make objective measurements of contrast sensitivity development and
deduce that the visual system was more mature (e.g. more functional) in
infancy than previously expected. Also measures of colour sensitivity.
Tinyeyes is based off those measurements. Other people: Tyler, Norcia,
Gunilla H-P, many of the people at SKERI in the 1980s and 90s. Norcia
86,88,90 - mentioned in Regan's nice autobiography :
https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Seeing_Spatial_Form/HqaKlR_GpP0C?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Analysis+of+EEG+responses+in+man,+evoked+by+sine+watre+modulated+light.+Thesis&pg=PA215&printsec=frontcover

In parallel of course, people were using frequency tagging to do single
unit work - the 1F vs 2F simple/complex cell classification scheme was
all about this (Lennie and others).

[]{#anchor-5}3. SSVEP in functional localization

Techniques like fMRI have been combined with SSVEP to achieve more
precise spatial localization (Di Russo et al., 2007). See however the
Ales cruciform paper.

Di Russo, F., Pitzalis, S., Spitoni, G., Aprile, T., Patria, F., Stella,
A., \... & Hillyard, S. A. (2007). Identification of the neural sources
of the pattern-reversal VEP. Neuroimage, 34(1), 177-189.

Ales and Norcia:\... (showed that people's intuition about V1 upper /
lower v.f reversing polarity wasn't really correct). This feels a little
outside our scope though\... We have also combined SSVEP with source
imaging techniques to probe responses in different cortical locations
(again, Ales papers, some early stuff from Stan K? Appelbaum, Wade,
Norcia figure/ground\...) and then a host of later work from that lab
and others.

[]{#anchor-6}4. SSVEP and contrast gain control including adaptation,
masking, and attention

\[The story goes: Up to the lte 90s people were primarily interested in
measuring contrast sensitivity - the shape of the response function was
assumed to be basically log-linear - and they fit it with straight lines
to extrapolate back to zero response. But then (once Heeger's 1992 paper
had sunk in - see also stuff like Shapley and Victor 1981 [(Shapley &
Victor, 1981)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zAmtgj)), people
started thinking about gain control - Candy and Norcia in about 1999,
Porciatti, probably a load of Tyler papers that I don't even know
about\...\]. Probably look in p

And then people worked out that if you can use SSVEP to measure contrast
responses, you can also use it to measure things that modulate contrast
responses. These include adaptation, masking, suppression, attention
(feature and space), clinical things.

[]{#anchor-7}Adaptation:

Continuous exposure to high-contrast patterns reduces contrast
sensitivity, which can be measured using SSVEP (Ross et al., 1989).
Others? Baker recent gain control paper is perhaps worth mentioning here
as a 'confound' of sorts. Engel 2018 [*(Vergeer et al.,
2018)*](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?kdURiS). This paper is
interesting [*(Rideaux et al.,
2023)*](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?J2EO3d) and \>sort\< of
SSVEP.

[]{#anchor-8}Masking:

High contrast masks can suppress the visibility of low contrast
patterns, which has implications in SSVEP amplitude (Haynes et al.,
2003).

Attention: Directing attention can enhance contrast sensitivity, as
shown in studies using SSVEP (Müller et al., 2006). Also Tsai
(dynamics), Baker / Wade (several), Winawer? I think JW has a nice
dynamic model of normalization with some MEG data. Busse et al cat/human

There is a lot of SSVEP interest these days because of BCIs. I think
it's pretty weak but there is \>so much\< of it that it might be worth
mentioning\...
